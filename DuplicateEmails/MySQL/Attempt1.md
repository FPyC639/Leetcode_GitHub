The time complexity for this SQL query is **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of rows in the `Person` table. This is because the query performs a `GROUP BY` operation on the `email` column, which typically requires scanning all rows once. The subsequent filtering (`WHERE B.ct >= 2`) operates on the grouped results.
```SQL
Select B.em As Email From 
(Select email AS em, COUNT(email) AS ct From Person GROUP BY em) AS B
Where B.ct >= 2;
```
