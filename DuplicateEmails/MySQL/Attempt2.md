**Time Complexity:**  
The query scans all rows in the `Person` table, groups them by `email`, and counts occurrences.  
- If there are `n` rows, the time complexity is **O(n)** (assuming efficient indexing on `email`).
- Without an index, grouping and counting may take up to **O(n log n)** due to sorting.

```SQL
Select email as Email from Person GROUP BY email Having COUNT(email) >= 2;
```
